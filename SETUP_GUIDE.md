## 🚀 Next Steps to Run Your App

### 1. Firebase Setup (Required)
Before running the app, you **must** set up Firebase:

1. **Create Firebase Project**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Enable Cloud Firestore
   - Enable Cloud Storage

2. **Android Configuration**:
   - Add Android app to Firebase
   - Download `google-services.json`
   - Place it in `android/app/` directory

3. **Update Build Files**:
   ```gradle
   // android/build.gradle
   dependencies {
       classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.15'
   }
   
   // android/app/build.gradle
   apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
   ```

### 2. Run the App
```bash
cd locket_widget_app
flutter run
```

## 📖 How to Use the App

### For Users:
1. **Download & Register**: Create account with email/password
2. **Add Friends**: Go to Friends tab, add friends by email
3. **Start Sharing**: Take photos with camera button, add captions, share
4. **View Feed**: See friends' photos on Home tab
5. **Manage Profile**: View your photos and settings in Profile tab

### For Developers:
- All Firebase operations are in the `services/` folder
- UI components are in `screens/` and `widgets/`
- Photo model defines the data structure
- Widget service is ready for home widget implementation

## 🔧 Advanced Features to Add

### 1. Home Widget (Android)
The foundation is there in `widget_service.dart`. To complete:
- Create Android widget layout files
- Configure widget provider in AndroidManifest.xml
- Implement actual HomeWidget integration

### 2. Push Notifications

- Send notifications when friends share photos
- Handle notification taps

### 3. Enhanced Features

- User avatars and profiles
- Privacy settings
- Photo compression and caching
- Offline support

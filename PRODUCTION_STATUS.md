1. Create app_icon.png (1024x1024)
2. Create splash_icon.png (512x512)
3. Run icon generators

**Option 3: Continue Code Quality** (30 minutes)
- Fix remaining 127 lint issues

## ðŸŽ® **Quick Test Build**

Let's test your current setup with a debug build:

```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

This will verify everything compiles correctly before doing a release build.
